      "# Why would I want to use this horrible thing?\n- The haunted mirror shows you what the ghost room/favorite room is!\n- Also helps confirm if the ghost changes its favorite room during an investigation\n# Haunted Mirror Facts\n- It DOES NOT show you where the ghost currently is\n- While looking into the mirror, it drains 7% sanity per second and a minimum of 20% per use. \n- If you run out of sanity, the mirror will break and a cursed hunt will start",
